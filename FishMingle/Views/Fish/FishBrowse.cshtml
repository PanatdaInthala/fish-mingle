              The first thing fish usually notice about me is my optimistic personality, closly followed by my dazzling gold scales and smashing tail. I'm the fish for you, if you are a fish who is into tails.

              I work as a tour guide, showing fish from other ponds the wonders of my pond. This allows me to exercise my skills: talking and being gazed at because I'm just that hot.</p>

              Something interesting about me: I have swum with sea turtles in a current all the way to the beaches of Australia that are infested with Humans from the Great Barrier Reef where I live, just me and a rather forgetful Royal Blue Tang named Dory (who found love through this very site!)

              I am a homemaker and work from home so I am always available to look after my family!</p>

                I am in search of someone who will accept me for me and will be understanding of my appearance.

                I work as a janitor in the School Of Fish (my pricks make it easy to reach those hard to clean places.)

              <p class="card-text">I have often been described by the ladies as a Bad Fish. Must be because of my size and awesome physique. Going to the gym is one of my life's passions and pushing my body to its limits.

                I am in training to be a boxer and I work as a police officer for the Fishopolis PD.

                I am looking for a gal who likes her fish bad and muscular and like going to the gym as much as I do.
